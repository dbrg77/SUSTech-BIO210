# Week 4, Tuesday


## Tuesday, 2022-Mar-08
All the content we have been discussing so far is, to some degree, old stuff from your previous study in high school. Today, we will finally introduce something new. Before that, we are first going to do a recap from your high school math class, again, on the principles of counting. Since we know from the __discrete uniform law__, calculating the probability of events with discrete outcomes is basically counting. Therefore, we need to know how to count efficiently. In addition, we will also introduce some notations that might be different from what your learned in high school. For example, the following notation:

$$C_{n}^{k}$$

is probably what you learned in your high school class, but in this course, we use this one:

$$\binom{n}{k}$$

which is the same thing. It reads "n choose k".

After the recap, we will introduce the first new concept in the course: __random variables__. It is a very important concpet, and you will see that it allows us to do many useful things. Using a __random variable__, we could directly discuss numbers without thinking about the __sample space ($\Omega$)__. We could also talk about the __expectation__ and __variance__ of a __random variable__ (often denoated as ___r.v.___).
