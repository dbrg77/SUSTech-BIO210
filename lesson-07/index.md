# Week 5, Friday


## Friday, 2022-Mar-18
Last week, we introduced __continuous random variables__. We see that all concepts about the continuous random variable are not new, and we already came across them when learning the __discrete random variables__. The difference is the way of making the calculations. In the discrete case, we do summation; in the continuous case, we do integration. On Friday this week, we introduce one of the most important continuous random variable and its disbribution: the normal random variable and the normal distribution. This is the only continuous random variable we will talk about in a entry level biostatistics course. We will see why it is so useful in real life and how to calculate the probablity.

Once we finish that, we finally have all the things we need to describe the probability distributions that are commonly seen in our real life. Then, we could move on to the statistics part. That is, using __samples__ to make inference about __populations__.

First, we need to clarify the concepts of __population__ and __sample__. We actually already talked about them, even though we have not formally defined them. I think most of you can immediately get an idea simply based on the meaning of those words. Anyway, we will define and tell the difference between them during the lecture.

I think it is helpful to put the following things in mind:

1. Don't think of a population as a collection of all people/subjects/items _etc_., even though it can be interpreted in this way. Instead, think of a population as an abstract thing that we are intereted in. It is not approachable directly, so we used a sample to make guesses about it.
2. A sample is some sort of a representation of the population. __A good sample is a micro-version of the population__. When we have a sample, the exact statictics about the sample, such as the mean, the variance _etc._, are not of our primary interest. What we really care about is what the sample actually represents, that is, the population.

You will see what those two points mean when we proceed during the course.
