# Week 15, Friday

__Congratulations!__

We have finally reached the end of the course. On Friday, we will first introduce some very pratical sklls to show you how to perform statistical analysis or extract information from data in general without any of the tests we learnt during the course. Let's say, if I don't have enough math or related skills, if I cannot figure out a particular sampling distribution, if I forget how to perform the tests _etc._, what can I do? Well, with the help of modern computers, we can use __probablistic thinking__ to solve many problems. We will see how to do that, without showing you vigorous proofs, but it should be intuitive.

Then, we will wrap up, do a brief overview of what we have learnt and introduce some common statistical errors people make in real life.

After that, you should be able to feel confident of using the techniques to solve real life problems.
