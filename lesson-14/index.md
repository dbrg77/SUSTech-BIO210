# Week 10, Friday

We have been talking about doing hypothesis testing for a particular population parameter, such as the population proportion $\pi$, the population mean $\mu$ and the population variance $\sigma^2$. We take one random sample from the population, and test if the population paramter is equal to or greater/less than a specific value. This is called a one-sample test. The specific value comes from our previous knowldge about the population.

In reality, we very often need to compare the proportions or means of two different groups. For example, we want to see if a drug can lower the blood pressure. We compare two groups of poeple, one with placebo, the other with the drug. In this case, we are comparing the means between the placebo group and the drug group. The two samples here represent two populations, one is the population with placebo, the other the population treated with the drug. We want to figure out the mean blood pressures of the two populations are equal or not.

This is a more useful test, called two-sample test. We will go though the procedures of performing hypothesis testing in this situation. The idea is the same as we did before.
