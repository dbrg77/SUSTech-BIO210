      <title>Lecture 4 Probability Axioms</title>

      <description>Probability Axioms After we finished the content of descriptive statistics, we will move on to the section of probability, which is really good at dealing with randomness. You have probably already come across some concepts of probability. In Lecture 4, we will make things formal. Probability axioms will be introduced. Those are the things we need to agree on. They are quite intuitive, and hopefully, you will have no problem accepting them as facts:</description>

      <title>Lecture 3 Numerical Measures</title>

      <description>Numerical Measures Lecture 3 concludes the section of descriptive statistics. From the previous lectures we demonstrated that graphs were a nice way of showing the data. One can immediately get a rough idea about how the data look like from a good graph. However, when the data is presented in graphs, the quantitative information in the data is lost. Therefore, it would be good if we could just use a bunch of numbers to summarise the data.</description>

      <title>Lecture 2 Descriptive Statistics</title>

      <description>Lecture 2 starts to introduce some basic techniques in descriptive statistics. You can think of this lecture as a recap of what you have already known in the past. Make sure you get familiar with all the graphs introduced in this lecture, because we are going to use them all the time in future lectures. Perhaps the most important graph in this course is the histogram, which is the most common way of showing frequency distributions:</description>

      <title>Lecture 1 Course Introduction</title>

      <description>In the first lecture of the entire course, we will have a brief overview of the course structure and content. Lecture 1 starts with some administrative aspects of the course. Then we will provide an introduction about what is and is not included in the course, what to expect from the course and the difference between BIO210 and MA212.
Your final grade is a weighted average 1 of the following:</description>
