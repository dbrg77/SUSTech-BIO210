      <description>Tuesday, 2022-Feb-22 On Tuesday this week, we will continue our lesson in descriptive statistics. We will introduce some numerical measurements that summarise the data. We introduce two most frequently used measurements which you will see repeatedly in this course and your real life: the mean and the variance. Some practcal skills and data visualisaiton tricks will be introduced as well.
Then we move on to the section of probability, which is really good at dealing with randomness.</description>

      <description>Friday, 2022-Feb-18 In this week, we will have a brief overview of the course structure and content and introduce some basic concepts of statistics. Lecture 1 provides a summary about what is and is not included in the course, what to expect from the course and the diference between BIO210 and MA212. Lecture 2 starts to introduce some basic techniques in descriptive statistics. You can think of the lectures as a recap of what you have already known in the past.</description>
