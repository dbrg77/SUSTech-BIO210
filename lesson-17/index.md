# Week 12, Friday


## Friday, 2022-May-06
In the previous two lectures, we talked about the idea of __ANOVA__. We see why it is called ANOVA when it is actually used to compare means. As you have already seen, the calculation involved in doing an ANOVA test, even for only three groups, is quite daunting, especially when you want to perform _post hoc_ tests. Therefore, in real life, you should always use a statistical software to perform this kind of test. On Friday this week, we will have one pratical session to showcase how to do ANOVA in __R__. If you bring you laptop, make sure you install __R__ via the [SUSTech CRAN mirror](https://mirrors.sustech.edu.cn/CRAN/) and download the [iris flower dataset](/src/iris_data.csv).

Then we will go on to introduce the __Chi-square goodness-of-fit__ test. It is useful when we want to compare some categorical distributions observed from the data to a theoretical distribution. We will go through the intuition, the logic and the use case of it. We are going to revisit what you learnt during high school: the Mendel's Plant Hybidization experiments. You will be introduced to a very famous debate in the history of science.
