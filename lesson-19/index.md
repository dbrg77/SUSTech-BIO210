# Week 14, Tuesday


## Tuesday, 2022-May-17
At the end of the previous lecture, we started to look at the relaship between two continuous variables. We introduced the simplest relationship: the linear relationship. Using Pearson's correlation coefficient (___r___), how good is the linear relationship can be quantified. However, that is not the whole story. I think everybody kind of has an urge to "fit" a line when we see a linear relationship in a scatter plot. It is kind of natural. More importantly, if the line can be found, it is obvious to see that the line has a prediction power.

When we say "we want to fit a line on the data", what do we mean by that? How to assess if the line is good or not? This is what we are going to do during the lectures on Tuesday. As you can see, it is a simple but powerful technique.
