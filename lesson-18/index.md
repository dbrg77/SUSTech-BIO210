# Week 13, Friday


## Friday, 2022-May-13
So far, we have been working on one variable of interest at a time, such as the mean, the proportion or the variance of a specific measurement. Starting this week, we will begin to focus on the relationship between two variables. On Friday, we will first look at how we could assess if there is any relationship between two categorical variables. We will finally finsihed what I have promised you in the previous lecture: we are going to reproduce the result from the paper [Relationship Between the ABO Blood Group and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Susceptibility](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32750119/) by Zhao _et al._ from our own university. This is a perfect example of the use of the __Chi-squre__ test. You should be able to see how the authors reached their conclusion and the rationale behind it.

Then, we will very briefly introduce the idea of assessing the relationship bewteen two continuous variables by introducing a new statistic. In the lectures next week, we will explore this idea and expand it further.
