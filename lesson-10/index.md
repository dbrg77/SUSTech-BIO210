# Week 7, Friday


## Friday, 2022-Apr-01
In the previous lectures, we talked about using the sample mean ($\bar{X}$ and $\bar{x}$) as the estimator and estimate for the population mean ($\mu$) and using the sample variance ($S^2$ and $s^2$) as the estimator and estimate for the population variance ($\sigma^2$). We also introduced one intuitive way of cosntructing an estimator: the __maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)__. You see, we are just using one specific value, that is, just one number, to estimate the population parameter. It is called a point estimation. It is undoubtfully useful, but the information we get from the point estimation is very limited. Once we get the estimation, it is just one number. What is the sample size? How confident are we about the estimation? We cannot get that from the point estimation.

A more useful way of making an estimation is the __invterval estimation__. As the name suggests, it is a range of values. We want to provide a range that may contain the true value of the population parameter that we are intereted in. On Friday, we will introduce the concepts of __confidence level__ and __confidence interval__. We will see how to interpret them, and how they are useful for us to make staistical inferences.
