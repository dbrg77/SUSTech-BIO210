# Week 10, Sunday


## Sunday, 2022-Apr-24
Due to the nation-wide holidays in May, we are having two lectures on Sunday morning, April 24th. First, we are going to talk about how to compare variances from two groups. It is not commonly used for this purpose _per se_, but it does involve in a very useful distribution: __the F distribution__. We will see how to and why to use the F distribution to compare two variances.

Then, we are going to stop a bit and talk about how to interpret the p-value correctly. More importantly, we are going to see the behaviour of the p-value when we are doing a lot of hypothesis testing. The content in this lecture is a bit advanced and will not be required for the exam, but it is very important for your future reference.
