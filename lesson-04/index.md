# Week 3, Friday


## Friday, 2022-Mar-04
On Friday this week, we will talk more about the __Bayes' Theorem__. We will use some more examples and practice to show you how to apply the theorem to solve real life problems. A different notation of the Bayes' formula will be introduced. In this case, we talk about __hypothesis__ and __evidence__, instead of the arbitrary events __A__ and __B__. Hopefully, this will help you not only remember the formula but also get an intuition about the theorem.

Then we introduce a concept that is not new but never formally defined: the concept of __independence__. The concept is very straightforward to understand. We will instroduce a mathematical way of checking if two events or a collection of events are independent or not. In reality, it is very difficult to check independence using the mathematical definition. Therefore, people very often assume the independence of events based on prior knowledge and intuition. However, we need to be very careful when doing so, as it might lead to wrong conclusions, which in certain situation can be catastrophic. We use __the Sally Clark case__ to demonstrate this point.
