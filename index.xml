      <title>Lecture 12 Continuous Random Variables</title>

      <description>Once we have seen some discrete random variables, we can move on to look at continuous random variables. As the name indicated, the numbers taken by a continuous random variable are continuous. Like we discussed before, in this case the probability of taking any specific number is zero. Therefore, it does NOT make sense to use PMF to describe a continuous random variable. Instead, we use probability density function (PDF), denoted by $f_X(x)$.</description>

      <title>Lecture 11 Discrete Random Variables</title>

      <description>Now we have introduced the concept of random variables, let&amp;rsquo;s look at some common random variables, starting with the easier cases of discrete random variables. They are common because we can easily relate them to our real-life events. Once we get familiar with them, we can use them to model and solve problems.
Bernoulli Random Variables Like I said before, when we first come across a new thing, always ALWAYS start with simple examples to get our intuition right.</description>

      <title>Lecture 10 Random Variables</title>

      <description>In this lecture, we introduced perhaps the first &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo;1 concept in this course: random variables. It is very important to understand the concepts of random variables and the expectation and variance of a random variable. When coming across something new, always start with something simple to get a rough idea. Therefore, we used some simple and intuitive examples, such as coin tossing, during the lectures.
Random Variables A random variable is defined as a a real-valued function defined on a sample space $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Lecture 9 Counting</title>

      <description>In Lecture 9, we paused a little bit and did a quick recap about the basic counting principles. The content was basically what you have learnt during your high school math classes but in English. You see that the counting principles we are talking about greatly help us calculate the probability of events consisting outcomes from discrete sample spaces.
You might ask why we bother to do a recap about counting.</description>

      <title>Lecture 8 Independent Events</title>

      <description>Lecture 8 introduced the concept of independence. It is a relatively straightforward concept to understand. Intuitively, events $A$ and $B$ are independent if:
$$\mathbb{P}(A|B)=\mathbb{P}(A), \mathbb{P}(B) \neq 0$$
Using Bayes&amp;rsquo; terms, we can say that the posterior probability is equal to the prior probability. In other words, event $B$ has nothing to do with $A$; event $B$ does not provide any information about event $A$; given that event $B$ has occurred, we do not change our belief about event $A$ &amp;hellip; Recall that from Lecture 5, we have:</description>

      <title>Lecture 7 More On The Bayes Theorem</title>
      <link>https://dbrg77.github.io/SUSTech-BIO210/posts/lecture-07/</link>

      <description>Lecture 7 introduced more examples of using the Bayes&amp;rsquo; theorem to help us make decisions in real life. Sometimes, the conclusion seems counterintuitive at the beginning. However, if you grasp the idea of &amp;ldquo;using the new information to update your prior belief&amp;rdquo;, you will find the Bayes&amp;rsquo;s rule very natural. We also introduced a new form of the Bayes&amp;rsquo; rule without talking about the events $A$, $B$ etc.:
$$\mathbb{P}(H_i|E) = \cfrac{\mathbb{P}(H_i)\mathbb{P}(E|H_i)}{\mathbb{P}(E)} = \cfrac{\mathbb{P}(E|H_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{P}(H_i)\mathbb{P}(E|H_i)} \cdot \mathbb{P}(H_i)$$</description>

      <description>Now we have get familiar with conditional probabilities. The basic definition and formula is:
$$\mathbb{P}(A|B)=\cfrac{\mathbb{P}(A \cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(B)} \textmd{, } \mathbb{P}(B) \neq 0$$
In the previous lecture, we used some examples to show how to calculate three probabilities: $\mathbb{P}(A \cap B)$, $\mathbb{P}(B)$ and $\mathbb{P}(A|B)$, which are essentially the three terms in the above formula. In reality, we sometimes need to calculate some very complicated probabilities, but they all boils down to some sort of combinations of those three probabilities.</description>

      <title>Lecture 5 Conditional Probability</title>

      <description>In Lectures 5, we have introduced the concept of conditional probability and see how we could use it to learn from the real world. Whenever we come across a new concept, the first thing is always to build up our intuition about it. Using a few simple examples, we start to get some ideas about conditional probabilities.
In conditional probability, we are interested in calculating the probability of an event when taking into account some knowledge that we have.</description>

      <title>Lecture 4 Probability Axioms</title>

      <description>Probability Axioms After we finished the content of descriptive statistics, we moved on to the section of probability, which is really good at dealing with randomness. You have probably already come across some concepts of probability. In Lecture 4, we just made things formal. Probability axioms were introduced in this lecture. Those are the things we need to agree on. They are quite intuitive, and hopefully, you have no problem accepting them as facts:</description>

      <title>Lecture 3 Numerical Measures</title>

      <description>Numerical Measures Lecture 3 concludes the section of descriptive statistics. From the previous lectures we demonstrated that graphs were a nice way of showing the data. One can immediately get a rough idea about how the data look like from a good graph. However, when the data is presented in graphs, the quantitative information in the data is lost. Therefore, it would be good if we could just use a bunch of numbers to summarise the data.</description>

      <description>Lecture 2 started to introduce some basic techniques in descriptive statistics. You can think of this lecture as a recap of what you have already known in the past. Make sure you get familiar with all the graphs introduced in this lecture, because we are going to use them all the time in future lectures. Perhaps the most important graph in this course is the histogram, which is the most common way of showing frequency distributions:</description>

      <description>In the first lecture of the entire course, we had a brief overview of the course structure and content. Lecture 1 started with some administrative aspects of the course. Then we provided an introduction about what is and is NOT included in the course, what to expect from the course and the difference between BIO210 and MA212.

      <description>This static website holds all course material from the BIO210 Biostatistics course delivered by the School of Life Sciences at SUSTech, Shenzhen. This is an entry level statistics course for undergraduates who have no prior knowledge about statistics at all. We do assume you are familiar with the math from your high school and the 1st year undergraduate training.
About This Website You can find all material listed in this Content Index page, typically a few days before or after the actual lesson.</description>
