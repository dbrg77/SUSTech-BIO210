# Week 2, Friday


## Friday, 2022-Feb-25
On Friday this week, we will introduce the concept of conditional probability and see how we could use it to learn from the real world. We will learn three important rules to help us for the calculation: __the multiplication rule__, __the total probability rule__ and __the Bayes' rule__. They allow us to systematically update our beliefs about certain events based on new information we just learnt. Conditional probability is both easy and difficult. It is easy in a way that conditional probability is just like normal probability but in a new universe. It is difficult in a way that conditional probability sometimes generates counter-intuitive results.

When dealing with conditional probability, put the following two things in your mind:

1. Conditional probability is just normal probability in a new universe or a different sample space (typically smaller). For those properties we have in the normal probability, we also have them in the conditional probability.
2. When analysing a real life problem, always ask yourself first: what is the probability of the event of interest before you see any new information. Then, once some new information is provided, do you change your original belief about the event?

Regarding the Bayes' rule, DO NOT simply memorise the equation. You will find youself confused when seeing a different version of it. Instead, put the two pictures that we introduced during the lecture and you will have no problem applying the Bayes' rule. I personally found those two pictures not only help with the calculation but also provide an intuition about the Bayes' rule. The intuition about a concept is often more important.
