# Week 2, Tuesday

## Tuesday, 2022-Feb-22
On Tuesday this week, we will continue our lesson in descriptive statistics. We will introduce some numerical measurements that summarise the data. We introduce two most frequently used measurements which you will see repeatedly in this course and your real life: the mean and the variance. Some practcal skills and data visualisaiton tricks will be introduced as well.

Then we move on to the section of probability, which is really good at dealing with randomness. You have probably already come across some concepts of probability. Here, we will make things formal. Probability axioms will be introduced. Those are the things we need to agree on. They are quite intuitive, and hopefully, you will have no problem accepting them as facts.
