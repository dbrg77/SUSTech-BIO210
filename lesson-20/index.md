# Week 14, Friday


## Friday, 2022-May-20
Previously, we have introduced and discussed the details of the __ordinary least square (OLS)__ regression model. In the first lecture on Friday, we will talk about how to perform some hypothesis testing on the slope ($\beta_1$) and the intercept ($\beta_0$) of the population regression line. In order to do that, we need to figure out their sampling distribution.

After that, we have finished the section of __simple linear regression__. In the second lecture, we will introduce some non-parametric tests to help deal with situations where the assumptions of previously discussed tests (such as $t$ and $z$ test) are violated.
