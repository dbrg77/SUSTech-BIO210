# About BIO210 Biostatistics


This static website holds all course material from the __BIO210 Biostatistics__ course delivered by the __School of Life Sciences__ at __SUSTech__, Shenzhen. The course is an entry level statistics course for undergraduates who have no prior knowledge about statistics at all. The course starts with some basic concepts and techniques of __descriptive statistics__. All of them are simple and straightforward to understand. You probably already came across them and even used some of them in your prevoius study in your high school. Here, we just make the definitions clear. Then, like many introductory statistics course, we first introduced __probability theory__ before we get into __statistics__. Probability theory allows us to make predictions about certain things (sample) when we know the ground truth (population). Only by knowing how things work in this direction can we make the inference about the ground truth (population) based on limited data (sample). After completing the section of probability theory, we moved on to statistics. We will use the tools and knowledge that we have learnt to make inference about the ground truth (population) with limited data (sample). We will also introduce some other practical and computational techniques, such as bootstrapping, permutation tests and simulations, to help us perform statistical analysis without the need of memorise all those different test statistics.

## Course details

{{< admonition type=success title="Goals of BIO210" open=True >}}
- Introduce basic concepts of statistics to those with no prior knowledge
- Help you feel justifiably confident of your ability to interpret
data/information from research articles and daily lives
- Select appropriate statistical methods for your problem
- __Help you formulate a statistical problem from real-life situation and use the numerical techniques to solve and extract information from it__

Some of you are also taking the __MA212 Probability and Statistics__ course offered by the Department of Mathematics. BIO210 is very different from MA212.

{{< admonition type=note title="Difference to MA212" open=True >}}
- Focused on data from basic biology and medicine
- Focused on application
- Focused on inferential statistics

Very often, it is important to know what the course is __NOT__ about.

{{< admonition type=info title="What is BIO210 NOT about" open=True >}}
- Bayesian statistics
- Mathematical proof (important proofs will be provided, though)
- Implementation
- How and where to find data
