# Week 9, Friday


## Friday, 2022-Apr-15
We have been using the property of the sampling distribution of the sample mean to make interval estimations of the population parameters, such as the mean ($\mu$), the variance ($\sigma^2$) and the proportion ($\pi$). They are very useful, but they are not the whole story of inferential statistics. Otherwise, the course will be much shorter.

On Friday this week, we will introduce a very powerful techinque: __the hypotheis testing__. As the name suggested, it allows us to test hypothesis. You see, we rarely know the properties of the population. By drawing samples and studying the data we have, we may come up with some hypotheses. For example, I was told that the normal body temperature is 37 $\degree C$, but the data I have suggest otherwise. Therefore, I hypothesise that the normal body temperature is not 37 $\degree C$. How do we figure out if the hypotheis is correct or not? Well ... the short answer is: we cannot.

Having said that, what we can do is to approach the problem indirectly. That is: using __hypothesis testing__. We will introduce the concept of hypothesis testing and the __p-value__. A very important goal in this course is to let you interpret p-values in the correct way. After the lectures, I hope you put the following equation in your head:

$$p-\textmd{value} = P(\textmd{observing \textbf{the data} we have or more extreme }|\ H_0 \textmd{ is true})$$

What does that mean? It is straigtforward to see that the p-value is basically a conditional probability. The probablity is about __the data__ which I put in bold fonts. It is NOT the probablity of $H_0$ being correct. You will be surprised to see how often people interpret the meaning of p-values in the wrong way.

We will elaborate this during the lectures using many examples.
